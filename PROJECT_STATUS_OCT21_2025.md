## 🔧 STARTUP PROCEDURE FOR TOMORROW

### 1️⃣ START BACKEND SERVER
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\kaz.roche\Desktop\music-intelligence\backend"
python simple_working.py
```
**Expected Output**: Flask server running on http://localhost:5000

### 2️⃣ START FRONTEND
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\kaz.roche\Desktop\music-intelligence"
npm start
```
**Expected Output**: React app opens at http://localhost:3000

### 3️⃣ TROUBLESHOOTING PORT 3000
If port 3000 is busy:
```powershell
# Find what's using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill the process (replace XXXX with PID from above)
taskkill /PID XXXX /F

# Then try npm start again
```

## 🎵 USER WORKFLOW (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)

### Step 1: Discover Playlists
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Select **Market** (e.g., "US", "France", "UK")
3. Select **Genre** (e.g., "Pop", "Hip-Hop", "Electronic")
4. Click **"Discover Playlists"**
5. ✅ Real Spotify playlists will load with follower counts

### Step 2: Load Tracks
1. Choose a playlist from the results
2. Click **"Load Tracks"**
3. ✅ Real tracks with ISRCs will display

### Step 3: Get Writer Credits + IPI Numbers
1. Click **"Get Writer Credits (Apple Music)"**
2. ✅ Processing will begin (10 tracks in fast mode)
3. ✅ Results show:
   - Writer/composer names
   - Artist IPI numbers (🎤)
   - Writer IPI numbers (✍️)
   - Total IPI count statistics

---

## 🔍 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Apple Music Authentication (WORKING)
```python
TEAM_ID = "2MQ6NB4Q3C"
KEY_ID = "FH2F6F277R"
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = "../AuthKey_FH2F6F277R.p8"
```

### IPI Extraction Method (FROM VISUAL STUDIO APPLE)
```python
# Artist IPI from Apple Music URLs using regex:
r'/artist/[^/]+/(\d{9,11})$'

# Writer IPI through Apple Music artist search
# Comprehensive tracking fields:
- main_artist_ipi: Artist's IPI number
- writer_ipis: Array of {name, ipi} for each writer
- all_ipi_numbers: Complete list of found IPIs
- total_ipis_found: Count of all IPIs discovered
```

### API Flow (TESTED & WORKING)
1. **Spotify** → Get playlists → Get tracks with ISRCs
2. **Apple Music** → Search by ISRC → Extract metadata + IPI using extend parameters
3. **Frontend** → Display writer credits with IPI numbers
4. **Statistics** → Show success rates and IPI counts
