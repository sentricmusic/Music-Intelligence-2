## 🌍 Multi-Market Intelligence

### Supported Markets
| Market | Code | Language Strategy | Genre Focus |
|---------|------|------------------|-------------|
| 🇫🇷 France | FR | French + English terms | Hip-Hop dominant |
| 🇬🇧 UK | GB | English variants | Pop + Electronic |  
| 🇩🇪 Germany | DE | German + English | Electronic + Pop |
| 🇪🇸 Spain | ES | Spanish terms | Pop + Latin |
| 🇺🇸 US | US | English (global) | All genres |
| 🇹🇭 Thailand | TH | Thai + English | Pop + Electronic |
| 🇯🇵 Japan | JP | Japanese + Romaji | Pop + Rock |

### Search Strategy Innovation
The platform uses a **3-tier search approach** to maximize playlist discovery:

1. **Market Code + Genre**: `"FR hip-hop"` - Catches local/regional playlists
2. **Genre Only**: `"hip-hop"` - Finds major international playlists  
3. **Full Market Name**: `"france hip-hop"` - Discovers English-titled playlists with local content

This approach solved the critical issue where Japan Pop searches were missing major English-titled playlists containing Japanese artists.
